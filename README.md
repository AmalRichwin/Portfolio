# Welcome to My Portfolio - Built with Astro

This is the codebase for my personal portfolio website, powered by the Astro framework.

## What is Astro?

Astro is a next-generation web framework that combines the best of server-side rendering (SSR) with the speed and flexibility of static sites. This means your portfolio will be:

- **Fast:** Blazing-fast loading times thanks to clever static site generation.
- **SEO-friendly:** All content is pre-rendered for search engines to crawl easily.
- **Interactive:** Dynamic elements and data fetching powered by JavaScript on the client-side.
- **Simple:** Easy to learn and use, even if you're not a hardcore developer.

## What's in this repository?

- **`src/pages`:** The heart of the portfolio, containing individual page components like "About", "Projects", and "Contact".
- **`src/components`:** Reusable UI components like buttons, cards, and navigation.
- **`src/config`:** Global configuration for the website, like the site title and description.
